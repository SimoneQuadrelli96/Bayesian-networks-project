\subsection{Fitting Algorithm}
The fitting algorithm used by the R package is called iterative proportional fitting (IPF) executes the following steps, for 2-d tables, until convergence.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each row of seed cells was proportionally adjusted to
    equal the marginal row totals (specifically, each cell was divided
    by the actual sum of the row of cells, then multiplied by the
    marginal row total).
    \item Each column of (already row-adjusted) cells was
    proportionally adjusted to equal the marginal column totals.
    This is the end of the first ‘Iteration’.
    \item The above steps were repeated until
    the selected level of convergence was reached.
\end{enumerate}
